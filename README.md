# Angular Quiz

This project is a place to learn about Angular development by implementing a [simple quiz]( https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-ta8b32?file=Readme.md ). The initial version quiz data hardcoded into a model. The current version now fetches data from a service as a stepping stone to accessing quiz data from a RESTful web service.
